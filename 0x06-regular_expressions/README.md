# Regular expression

In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. I practiced building them using Ruby's Oniguruma library.

All code in this directory was tested using [Rubular](https://rubular.com/). Rubular is a Ruby-based regular expression editor. It's a handy way to test regular expressions as you write them.
